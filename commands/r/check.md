# R Package Check

Run `R CMD check` (via `rcmdcheck`) and report structured results.

## Process

1. Resolve package path from `$ARGUMENTS` (default: current dir).
2. `python3 -m lib.rcmd --kind check --path "<path>"` (add `--as-cran`, `--strict`,
   and/or `--incoming` if requested).
3. Render the JSON envelope below. Do not re-run R yourself.
4. If `--changed` is set: run `python3 -m lib.rcmd --kind check --changed
   --base "<ref>" --path "<path>"`. The envelope gains a `changed` block with
   `packages` (the changed package(s) the check was scoped to) plus a
   `tagging deferred` message. **`introduced`/`pre-existing` tagging is NOT YET
   WIRED** — an honest comparison needs a merge-base checkout (running R against
   the fork point in a detached worktree), which is not built yet. Until then
   `--changed` is **scope-only**: it runs the full check on the changed
   package(s) and reports the REAL full status. Render the full check result as
   usual.

## Usage

```bash
/rforge:r:check                    # single --as-cran pass (default; unchanged)
/rforge:r:check --as-cran          # explicit --as-cran pass
/rforge:r:check --strict           # two extra flavor passes (see below)
/rforge:r:check --incoming         # --strict + a third CRAN-incoming pass
/rforge:r:check --changed --base dev   # scope the check to the changed package(s) — scope-only
```

- **`--changed`** — scopes the check to the R package(s) touched on this branch
  (diff vs `merge-base(HEAD, --base)`; `--base` defaults to `HEAD` = uncommitted
  working-tree changes) and reports their REAL full check status. The exit status
  reflects the actual findings on those packages, so a real ERROR/WARNING/NOTE
  surfaces. **`introduced`/`pre-existing` tagging is NOT YET WIRED** (it needs a
  merge-base checkout that isn't built), so `--changed` is currently scope-only —
  it does NOT yet answer "did *my* change cause this?". `--changed-strict` is a
  documented no-op reserved for when tagging lands. Degrades gracefully: not a git
  repo / no merge-base → a full check + a warning; no changes → a clean no-op.

- **Plain `r:check` (no flag)** — unchanged: one `--as-cran` pass, one `check` stage row.
- **`--strict`** — runs **both** Suggests-withholding flavor passes as two distinct
  stage rows, each with `--run-donttest` (so `\donttest{}` examples actually run):
  - `check (noSuggests)` — `_R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_=true`: withholds every `Suggests`
    package, so a `Suggests` dependency used unconditionally **fails here** (the class CRAN's
    post-acceptance flavor catches but plain `--as-cran` misses).
  - `check (suggests-only)` — `_R_CHECK_SUGGESTS_ONLY_=true`: catches undeclared-package use.
- **`--incoming`** — **implies `--strict`** and adds a third `check (incoming)` row using the
  CRAN-incoming env switches (`_R_CHECK_CRAN_INCOMING_`, `_R_CHECK_CRAN_INCOMING_REMOTE_`).
  `--as-cran` already enables the incoming block, so this bundle is intentionally small.

These are the same strict passes `/rforge:r:cran-prep` runs **by default** — one mental
model across both commands. Mechanism: `rcmdcheck`'s `env=` named vector; no `devtools`,
no subprocess-layer change.

!!! warning "Behavior change — a package green under `--as-cran` can turn red under `--strict`"
    A package that passes plain `r:check`/`--as-cran` can fail the `check (noSuggests)` pass
    once it detects a `Suggests` package used unconditionally. This is intended.

    **Fix:** A `Suggests` package is used unconditionally. Move it to `Imports`, or guard with
    `requireNamespace()` in code **and** `skip_if_not_installed()` in tests.

!!! note "Cost"
    `--strict` runs ≈ 2× the work of a plain check (two extra passes); `--incoming` adds a
    third. Acceptable for a pre-submission gate.

## Output Format

```markdown
## Package Check: {package} v{version}
### Status: {🟢 ok / 🟡 warn / 🔴 error}
### R CMD Check
- Errors: {len check.errors}
- Warnings: {len check.warnings}
- Notes: {len check.notes}
{list each message as a bullet, if any}
{If check.notes_classified is non-empty:}
### NOTE classification
{For each check.notes_classified: "🟢 expected — {text}" (kind=spurious) or
 "🔴 needs attention — {text}" (kind=real)}
### Recommended Actions
{1-3 steps, or "None — package is clean ✅"}
```

If `engine_missing` is non-empty, report 🔴 with the install hint from `messages`.
