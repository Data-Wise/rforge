**R package ecosystem orchestrator for Claude Code — {{ rforge.command_count }} commands, R-aware hooks, validation skills.**

!!! tip "TL;DR (30 seconds)"
    - **What:** R package *ecosystem* analysis from inside Claude Code. {{ rforge.command_count }} slash commands.
    - **Why:** Fast feedback on multi-package R repos — discovery, dependencies, change impact, CRAN cascade planning.
    - **How:** `brew install data-wise/tap/rforge`, then `/rforge:analyze "<what changed>"`.
    - **Next:** [Quick Start](QUICK-START.md) (3 min) → [Where to start](#where-to-start) below.

Self-contained R package analysis for Claude Code. Since v1.3.0 the plugin is fully self-sufficient — pure-Python `lib/` modules handle discovery, dependencies, status, and init. **No MCP server, no Node.js** at runtime. The fast ecosystem commands (analysis, deps, status) are pure Python; the `r:*` dev-cycle commands and `/rforge:thorough` shell out to R via `lib/rcmd.py`.

## What rforge is — and isn't

!!! abstract "rforge orchestrates an ecosystem; it does not build packages"
    rforge sits **alongside** the standard R toolchain, it doesn't replace it.

    - **`usethis` / `devtools`** scaffold, document, test, and build a *single* package.
    - **rforge** answers cross-cutting questions: *Which packages exist here? What depends on what? If I change `medfit`, what breaks downstream? In what order do I submit to CRAN?*

    If you're looking for `create_package()` or `document()`, that's `usethis`/`devtools`. rforge picks up where they leave off — see **[rforge in the R package lifecycle](tutorials/rforge-in-the-r-lifecycle.md)** for exactly where each tool plugs in.

## The 3 headline commands

Most daily work runs through these; the rest of the plugin's {{ rforge.command_count }} commands are specialized — see the [Reference Card](REFCARD.md).

```bash
# Ultra-fast snapshot (< 10 seconds) — pre-commit
/rforge:quick

# Balanced analysis with impact + recommendations (~30 seconds) — after changes
/rforge:analyze "Update RMediation bootstrap algorithm"

# Per-package CRAN gate (v2.2.0+) — document→strict check→Tier 4→revdep, writes cran-comments.md
/rforge:r:cran-prep

# Ecosystem rollup (2-5 minutes) — cross-package validation + submission order
/rforge:thorough "Prepare for CRAN release"
```

## What's new in v2.10.0

Three additive features — now {{ rforge.command_count }} commands.

- **`/rforge:r:s7-review`** — a static **S7 OOP convention checker**. Scans `R/*.R` + `NAMESPACE` across five families — naming, validators, methods, legacy (S4/R5/S3 leftovers), and docs — and reports advisory "looks like / consider" findings. **Advisory only, never blocks**, mirroring `r:cran-prep`'s Tier-4 tone. Pure Python (no R, no Rscript), no `--write`. See the [`s7review` reference](reference/s7review.md).
- **Scaffolding for existing packages** — `/rforge:r:use-test`, `/rforge:r:use-package`, `/rforge:r:use-vignette`. Draft a testthat file (one `test_that()` per branch, assertions left as `# TODO`), declare a dependency (Imports-vs-Suggests auto-picked via `deps_sync`, with an `@importFrom` tag), or scaffold a vignette/article skeleton. **Dry-run by default**; `--write` applies, `--force` overwrites. See the [`scaffold` reference](reference/scaffold.md) and the [scaffolding tutorial](tutorials/scaffolding-existing-packages.md).
- **diff-aware `--changed`** — a new flag on `/rforge:r:check`, `/rforge:r:test`, and `/rforge:r:lint` that scopes the run to the package(s) changed on this branch (diff vs `merge-base(HEAD, --base)`). On `r:check` it also tags every finding `[introduced]` vs `[pre-existing]` — a clean answer to "did *my* change cause this?" — with `--changed-strict` to count pre-existing findings toward exit too. See the [`changed` reference](reference/changed.md).

## What's new in v2.9.0

- **The [orchestrator agent](orchestrator.md), reborn** — ask a *goal* ("is this CRAN-ready?", "what's the impact of this change?") instead of picking commands, and the orchestrator recognizes the intent and runs the right read-only analyses, then synthesizes one summary. It now delegates through the pure-Python `lib/*` modules (the old MCP-tool delegation, dead since v1.3.0, is gone), recognizes **7 intents**, and enforces a **read-only / recommend-only safety boundary** — anything that writes files or hits the network is recommended, never auto-run. See the [orchestrator cookbook](tutorials/orchestrator-cookbook.md) for worked examples.
- **`Ecosystem.manifest_order`** (#20) — discovery now exposes the manifest's *declared* package order, so `/rforge:status` can render in a curated order rather than alphabetical.

## What's new in v2.8.0

- **Single-source version/count for docs** — the docs now render the current version and command count from one source of truth, so they stop drifting. A **mkdocs-macros** layer renders `{{ rforge.version }}` / `{{ rforge.command_count }}` at build time, and pure-stdlib **`scripts/version_sync.py`** stamps the surfaces macros can't reach (`README.md`, `plugin.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, …); its `--check` is a CI drift gate wired into `ci.yml` + `test-all.sh`. No command-surface change — still {{ rforge.command_count }} commands.

## What's new in v2.7.0

- **`r:submit --universe`** — opt-in **R-universe early-access tier**. Verifies your package's R-universe build (CRAN-like binaries rebuilt from GitHub within minutes) so users can install the new version while CRAN review runs in parallel. Auto-detects the universe from the git `origin` remote (`--universe-name <owner>` to override), reports per-platform build status, and prints the `install.packages(..., repos=...)` snippet. **Read-only** (R-universe builds on `git push`); status is **advisory** in the CRAN checklist and never blocks the still-manual CRAN handoff. Backed by new pure-stdlib `lib/runiverse.py` (`urllib`-only); degrades to `warn` offline/unregistered.

## What's new in v2.6.0

- **`r:submit`** — wraps the moment of CRAN submission: gate on `r:cran-prep` `ready` → build the tarball → cut a GitHub **pre-release** (not "Latest") of it with `cran-comments.md` → print the CRAN submit checklist (**never auto-submits**). `r:submit --promote` flips the pre-release to a full release on acceptance. Using a pre-release promoted in place sidesteps tagging a final release before acceptance. Backed by pure-Python `lib/ghrelease.py`.

## What's new in v2.5.0

- **`r:deps-sync`** — reconciles `DESCRIPTION` against actual code usage. Scans `R/`/tests/vignettes + `NAMESPACE` and reports **missing** (used, undeclared → Imports), **misclassified** (in Suggests but used unconditionally in `R/` → Imports — the static sibling of `r:check --strict`'s noSuggests pass), **missing_suggests**, and **unused** dependencies, plus a suggested patch. Report-only by default; `--write` applies the unambiguous changes. Pure-Python `lib/deps_sync.py`.

## What's new in v2.4.0

- **Ecosystem-manifest discovery** (`/rforge:detect`, `/rforge:status`) — discovery optionally reads a curated **ecosystem manifest** (via a `manifest:` key in `.rforge.yaml`) and enriches packages with `role`/`repo`/`cran` metadata, reporting **drift** between the manifest and what's on disk. Vendored YAML-subset parser keeps `discovery.py` stdlib-only. Zero behavior change when no manifest is configured.

## What's new in v2.3.0

- **CRAN-incoming hardening for `r:check` + `r:cran-prep`** — the submission gate now emulates CRAN's *incoming* and post-acceptance flavors. `r:check --strict` runs **both** Suggests-withholding passes (`check (noSuggests)` + `check (suggests-only)`, each with `--run-donttest`); `--incoming` adds the opt-in `check (incoming)` env-var bundle. `r:cran-prep` runs the strict passes **by default**, and a strict ERROR **blocks** the `ready` verdict.
- **Tier 4 advisory checks (new `lib/cranlint.py`, pure stdlib, no R)** — three `cran-prep` stages that never block `ready`: `description` (DESCRIPTION incoming nits — non-`Authors@R`, weak `Title`, `Description` prose, stale `Date`), `build-hygiene` (planning/dev docs that would ship in the tarball, with the exact `.Rbuildignore` regex to add), and `docs-consistency`.

!!! warning "Behavior change in v2.3.0"
    A package that reports 🟢 `ready` today under `--as-cran` can turn 🔴 once the noSuggests pass catches a `Suggests` package used unconditionally (the medfit 0.2.1 class). This is intended — CRAN would bounce such a package post-acceptance. Move the dependency to `Imports`, or guard it with `requireNamespace()` + `skip_if_not_installed()`.

## What's new in v2.2.0

- **5 new `r:` CRAN-submission commands**: `r:revdep`, `r:goodpractice`, `r:winbuilder`, `r:rhub`, `r:cran-prep` — full pre-submission gate that runs document→lint→spell→urlcheck→test→coverage→check(--as-cran)→revdep, generates `cran-comments.md`, and returns a `ready`/`warn`/`blocked` verdict.
- **`r:check` NOTE classifier**: notes are now classified as `spurious` (expected on CRAN submission) or `real` (needs attention) using `notes_classified` in the envelope.
- **Total: 28 → 33 commands.**

## What's new in v2.1.0

- 🔬 **12 new `r:` commands** (`r:load`, `r:document`, `r:test`, `r:coverage`, `r:build`, `r:install`, `r:site`, `r:cycle`, `r:lint`, `r:spell`, `r:urlcheck`, `r:style`) — full R package dev cycle + quality layer.
- 🐍 **`lib/rcmd.py`** — new module running lower-level R engines (`rcmdcheck`, `pkgbuild`, `roxygen2`, `testthat`, `pkgload`, `covr`, `pkgdown`, `lintr`, `spelling`, `urlchecker`, `styler`); structured JSON output; optional engines degrade gracefully.
- **Total: 16 → 28 commands.**

## What's new in v2.0.0 (BREAKING)

- 🔀 **3 commands renamed** for cleaner namespacing — `/rforge:doc-check` → `/rforge:docs:check`, `/rforge:ecosystem-health` → `/rforge:health`, `/rforge:rpkg-check` → `/rforge:r:check`. The other 13 commands are unchanged. Typing an old name produces a helpful rename-error pointing at the new name — no silent failures. See the [v2.0.0 migration tutorial](migration/v2.0.0-rename.md) for the full mapping table and a `sed` recipe to mass-update local scripts.

## What's new in v1.3.0

- 🎯 **MCP absorption complete** — the prior `rforge-mcp` prototype was absorbed into the plugin. All capabilities now ship as pure-Python `lib/` modules. See the [migration guide](migration/rforge-mcp-deprecation.md).
- 🐍 **`lib/status.py`** — ecosystem health snapshot (`DESCRIPTION` + `.STATUS` parsing): `python3 -m lib.status`.
- 🌱 **`lib/init.py`** — `~/.rforge/context.json` initializer behind the new `/rforge:init` command.
- 📦 **No runtime dependencies beyond Python 3.10+**.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Needed for |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code CLI** | everything (this is a Claude Code plugin) |
| **Python 3.10+** on PATH | the `lib/` modules (`discovery`, `deps`, `status`, `init`) |
| **R 4.0+** (+ optional engines via `lib.rcmd`) | all `r:*` commands and `/rforge:thorough` |

## Installation

```text
/plugin marketplace add Data-Wise/rforge
/plugin install rforge
```

Restart Claude Code so the commands register, then verify with `/help` (look for `/rforge:` entries). Homebrew, npm, and from-source options are in [Installation](installation.md).

> **Migrating from v1.2.x?** If `~/.claude/settings.json` still has an `mcpServers.rforge` entry, it's no longer needed — remove it. See the [migration guide](migration/rforge-mcp-deprecation.md).

## Design principles (ADHD-friendly)

1. **Fast feedback** — `/rforge:quick` returns in seconds, not minutes.
2. **Clear structure** — consistent, scannable output across commands.
3. **Visual progress** — you see what's happening as it happens.
4. **Always actionable** — every result ends with next steps.
5. **Interruptible & incremental** — results stream as they complete.
